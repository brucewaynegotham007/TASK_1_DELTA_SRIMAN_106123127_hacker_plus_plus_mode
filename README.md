Couldn't come up with ideas for power ups .. 
Came up with 3 for timed mode .. 
but their implementations for multiple players couldn't be achieved due to the nature of the power ups and their activation conditions .. 
2 power ups could potentially work for normal mode .. but due to activation conditions , it couldn't be made to work for multiple players .. 
Everything else has been working well to the best of my knowledge ..
